# Food Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms to recommend foods to users based on their past preferences. The project utilizes a dataset of food preferences collected from users and applies various machine learning algorithms to make recommendations.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code:
•	Pandas
•	Numpy
•	Scikit-learn
•	Matplotlib
•	rake_nltk
•	seaborn


## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Alihaider-ai/food-recomendation-system-using-machine-learning.git`
2. Install the required packages
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file: `jupyter notebook food-recommendation-system.ipynb`

## Results

The machine learning algorithms used in this project include Collaborative Filtering using Matrix Factorization and Content-based Filtering. The results of each algorithm were evaluated using accuracy, precision and recall. The best-performing algorithm was Collaborative Filtering using Matrix Factorization. The results are visualized in the Jupyter Notebook file.

## Conclusion

This project provides a proof-of-concept for using machine learning algorithms to make food recommendations based on user preferences. The results demonstrate the potential of these algorithms for providing personalized recommendations and the code can be modified and expanded to further improve the recommendation system.
